### The Praxeological Aspect of Polylogism

An ideology in the Marxian sense of this term is a doctrine which, although erroneous from the point of view of the correct logic of the proletarians, is beneficial to the selfish interests of the class which has developed it. An ideology is objectively vicious, but it furthers the interests of the thinker's class precisely on account of its viciousness. Many Marxians believe that they have proved this tenet by stressing the point that people do not thirst for knowledge only for its own sake. The aim of the scientist is to pave the way for successful action. Theories are always developed with a view to practical application. There are no such things as pure science and the disinterested search for truth.

For the sake of argument we may admit that every effort to attain truth is motivated by considerations of its practical utilization for the attainment of some end. But this does not answer the question why an "ideological"--i.e., a false--theory should render better service than a correct one. The fact that the practical application of a theory results in the outcome predicted on the basis of this theory is universally considered a confirmation of its correctness. It is paradoxical to assert that a vicious theory is from any point of view more useful than a correct one.

Men use firearms. In order to improve these weapons they developed the science of ballistics. But, of course, precisely because they were eager to hunt game and to kill one another, a correct ballistics. A merely "ideological" ballistics would not have been of any use.

For the Marxians the view that scientists labor for knowledge alone is nothing but an "arrogant pretense" of the scientists. Thus they declare that Maxwell was led to his theory of electromagnetic waves by the craving of business for wireless telegraphs.[^6] impelled Maxwell to formulate a correct theory or an ideological superstructure of the selfish class interests of the bourgeoisie. There is no doubt that bacteriological research was instigated not only by the desire to fight contagious diseases, but also by the desire of the producers of wine and of cheese to improve their methods of production. But the result obtained was certainly not "ideological" in the Marxian sense.

What induced Marx to invent his ideology-doctrine was the wish to sap the prestige of economics. He was fully aware of his impotence to refute the objections raised by the economists to the practicability of the socialist schemes. In fact he was so fascinated by the theoretical system of British classical economics that he firmly believed in its impregnability. He either never learned about the doubts that the classical theory of value raised in the minds of judicious scholars, or, if he ever heard of them, he did not comprehend their weight. His own economic ideas are hardly more than a garbled version of Ricardianism. When Jevons and Menger inaugurated a new era of economic thought, his career as an author of economic writings had already come to an end; The first volume of *Das Kapital* had already been published several years previously. Marx's only reaction to the marginal theory of value was that he postponed the publication of the later volumes of his main treatise. They were made accessible to the public only after his death.

In developing the ideology-doctrine Marx exclusively aims at economics and the social philosophy of Utilitarianism. His only intention was to destroy the reputation of economic teachings which he was unable to refute by means of logic and ratiocination. He gave to his doctrine the form of a universal law valid for the whole historical age of social classes because a statement which is applicable only to one individual historical event could not be considered as a law. For the same reasons he did not restrict its validity to economic thought only, but included every branch of knowledge.

The service which bourgeois economics rendered to the bourgeoisie was in Marx's eyes twofold. It aided them first in their fight against feudalism and royal despotism and then later again in their fight against the rising proletarian class. It provided a rational and moral justification for capitalist exploitation. It was, if we want to use a notion developed after Marx's death, a rationalization of the claims of the capitalists.[^8] The capitalists, in their subconsciousness ashamed of the mean greed motivating their own conduct and anxious to avoid social disapproval, encouraged their sycophants, the economists, to proclaim doctrines which could rehabilitate them in public opinion.

Now, recourse to the notion of rationalization provides a psychological description of the incentives which impelled a man or a group of men to formulate a theorem or a whole theory. But it does not predicate anything about the validity or invalidity of the theory advanced. If it is proved that the theory concerned is untenable, the notion of rationalization is a psychological interpretation of the causes which made their authors liable to error. But if we are not in a position to find any fault in the theory advanced, no appeal to the concept of rationalization can possibly explode its validity. If it were true that the economists had in their subconsciousness no design other than that of justifying the unfair claims of the capitalists, their theories could nevertheless be quite correct. Their is no means to expose a faulty theory other than to refute it by discursive reasoning and to substitute a better theory for it. In dealing with the theorem of Pythagoras or with the theory of comparative cost, we are not interested in the psychological factors that impelled Pythagoras and Ricardo to construct these theorems, although these things may be important for the historian and the biographer. For science the only relevant question is whether or not these theorems can stand the test of rational examination. The social or racial background of their authors is beside the point.

It is a fact that people in the pursuit of their selfish interests try to use doctrines more or less universally accepted by public opinion. Moreover, they are eager to invent and to propagate doctrines which they could possibly use for furthering their own interests. But this does not explain why such doctrines, favoring the interests of a minority and contrary to the interests of the rest of the people, are endorsed by public opinion. No matter whether such "ideological" doctrines are the product of a "false consciousness," forcing a man to think unwittingly in a manner that serves the interests of his class, or whether they are the product of a purposeful distortion of truth, they must encounter the ideologies of other classes and try to supplant them. Then a rivalry between antagonistic ideologies emerges. The Marxians explain victory and defeat in such conflicts as an outcome of the interference of historical providence. Geist, the mythical prime mover, operates according to a definite plan. He leads mankind through various preliminary stages to the final bliss of socialism. Every stage is the product of a certain state of technology; all its other characteristics are the necessary ideological superstructure of this technological state. Geist causes man to bring about in due time the technological ideas adequate to the stage in which he lives, and to realize them. All the rest is an outgrowth of the state of technology. The hand-mill made feudal society; the steam-mill made capitalism.[^9] Human will and reason play only an ancillary role in these changes. The inexorable law of historical development forces men--independently of their wills--to think and to behave according to the patterns corresponding to the material basis of their age. Men fool themselves in believing that they are free to choose between various ideas and between what they call truth and error. They themselves do not think; it is historical providence that manifests itself in their thoughts.

This is a purely mystical doctrine. The only proof given in its support is the recourse of Hegelian dialectics. Capitalistic private property is the first negation of individual private property. It begets, with the inexorability of a law of nature, its own negation, namely common ownership of the means of production.[^10] It is an undeniable fact that there prevails an irreconcilable conflict of interests between those workers who are employed at union wage rates and those who remain unemployed because the enforcement of union rates prevents the demand for and the supply of labor from finding the appropriate price for meeting. It is no less true that the interests of the workers of the comparatively overpopulated countries and those of the comparatively underpopulated countries are antagonistic with regard to migration barriers. The statement that the interests of all proletarians uniformly require the substitution of socialism for capitalism is an arbitrary postulate of Marx and the other socialists. It cannot be proved by the mere assertion that the socialist idea is the emanation of proletarian thought and therefore certainly beneficial to the interests of the proletariat as such.

A popular interpretation of the vicissitudes of British foreign trade policies, based on the ideas of Sismondi, Frederick List, Marx, and the German Historical School, runs this way: In the second part of the eighteenth century and in the greater part of the nineteenth century the class interests of the British bourgeoisie required a free trade policy. Therefore British political economy elaborated a free trade doctrine, and the British manufacturers organized a popular movement which finally succeeded in abolishing protective tariffs. Then later conditions changed. The British bourgeoisie could no longer stand the competition of foreign manufacturing and badly needed protective tariffs. Consequently the economists substituted a theory of protection for the antiquated free trade ideology, and Great Britain returned to protectionism.

The first error in this interpretation is that it considers the "bourgeoisie" as a homogeneous class composed of members whose interests are identical. A businessman is always under the necessity of adjusting the conduct of his business to the institutional conditions of his country. In the long run he is, in his capacity as entrepreneur and capitalist, neither favored nor injured by tariffs or the absence of tariffs. He will turn to the production of those commodities which under the given state of affairs he can most profitably produce. What may hurt or further his short-run interests are only *changes* in the institutional setting. But such changes do not affect the various branches of business and the various enterprises in the same way and to the same extent. A measure that benefits one branch or enterprise may be detrimental to other branches or enterprises. What counts for a businessman is only a limited number of customs items. And with regard to these items the interests of various branches and firms are mostly antagonistic.

The interests of every branch or firm can be favored by all kinds of privileges granted to it by the government. But if privileges are granted to the same extent also to the other branches and firms, every businessman loses--not only in his capacity as consumer, but also in his capacity as buyer of raw materials, half-finished products, machines and other equipment--on the one hand as much as he profits on the other. Selfish group interests may impel a man to ask for protection for his own branch or firm. They can never motivate him to ask for universal protection for all branches or firms if he is not sure to be protected to a greater extent than the other industries or enterprises.

Neither were the British manufacturers from the point of view of their class concerns more interested in the abolition of the Corn Laws than other British citizens. The landowners were opposed to the repeal of these laws because a lowering of the prices for agricultural products reduced the rent of land. A special class interest of the manufacturers can only be construed on the basis of the long since discarded iron law of wages and the no less untenable doctrine that profits are an outcome of the exploitation of the workers.

For inside world wey dey organised unda de  basis of division of labor, all change must to affect de short-run interest of many groups one way or anoda. So e dey easy to expose all doctrine wey dey support  make dem change condition wey don dey exist as "Ideological" disguise of de selfish interest of one special group of people. De main work of many authors of nowadays dey show us some truth. Nor be Marx wey invent dis procedure. Dem don know am already before im come. De most curious way wey im show im sef na for de attempt wey some eighteen-century writers been make to explain religious tori as tori wey dey deceive for de part of de priest dem wey want gain power and wealth for dia sef and dia people, dose wey dey exploit oda people. De Marxians stamp dis tori to label religion "opium for de country people." [^12]  de supporters of dis teaching nor know say where selfish interest pro dey selfish interest contra go dey too. E nor get any how wey dis one take be beta explanation of any event say e favour one special class. De question wey dey ground na why de rest of de population wey dis thing injure dia interest nor succeed to wreck de endeavors of dose people wey e favour.

Every firm and every branch of business dey for de short run, dem get interest for increased sales of dia product. For de long run, howeva one tendency dey prevail toward make all returns dey equal inside de various branches of production. If demand for de product of one branch increase and e raise profit, more capital go flow enta and de  competition of de new enterprise dem go cut down de profit. E nor get how returns go high for de sale of articles wey go damage sociality pass to sell acticle wey go benefit sociality. If one particular branch of business break  law and dose wey put body inside get to face prosecution, penalties and imprisonment, gross profit must to high well to compensate for de risk wey dey inside.  But dis one nor dey interfere with de height of net returns.

Rich people, de people wey get de plants wey dey operate already, nor get particular class interest to maintain free competition. Dem nor dey like confiscation and expropriation of dia property, but de interest wey dem get inside dey favour de ways to prevent newcomers to challenge dia position. Dose wey dey fight for free enterprise and free competition nor dey defend de interest of dose rich people today. Dem want unknown men to get free hand, wey go be de entrepreneurs of  tomorrow and  wey dia skills go make de life of next generation dem to dey more agreeable. Dem want make de road dey open for more economic improvement. Dem be de spokesmen of material progress.

De nineteenth-century success of free trade ideas been happen cos of de theories of class economics. De respect wey dis idea dem get been huge so tay dose wey dis theory hurt dia selfish class interest nor fit hinder  dia endorsement by public opinion and wetin dem don know by legislative measures. Na idea wey dey make history, nor be history wey dey make ideas.

E nor get any use to argue with dose wey get spiritual eye. Dem dey give tori based on dia intuition and dem nor get time to check weda e make sense or not. De Marxians pretend say wetin dia inner voice dey talk na history dey reveal im sef. If oda people nor hear dis voice e mean say dem nor be chosen ones. Na insult say dose wey dey struggle for darkness go come dey argue with dose wey get inspiration. Decency suppose make dem to creep go one corner and keep quiet.

Howeva, science nor fit stop to dey think, although e dey obvious say e nor go eva succeed to convince dose wey argue say reason na supreme. Science must to emphasize say to use intuition nor go fit answer de question say na which of several antagonistic doctrine be de right one and which one dey wrong. Na fact we nor dey deniable say Marxism nor be de only advance doctrine or our time. Oda "ideology" dey apart from Marxism. De Marxians dey assert say to apply all dis oda doctrines go hurt de interest of many people. But de supporters of dis doctrine dem dey talk de same thing about Marxism.

Of cos, de Marxians consider one doctrine bad if de person wey write am nor dey of low social status. But who dey for low social status ? Doctor Marx, de manufacturer and de "exploiter" Engels, and Lenin, de rich Russian gentle men, nor get proletarian background. But Hitler and Mussolini na people from low social status, and dem spend dia youth age for poverty. De conflict wey dey between de Bolshevik and de Mensheviks or de one between Stalin and Trotsky nor go fit fall under class conflicts. Dose ones na conflict between various sect of fanatics dem wey dey call dia sef traitors.

De essence of Marxian philosophy na dis one: We dey right cos na we be de spokesmen of de rising proletarian class. Discursive reasoning nor go fit spoil our teachings, cos na de supreme power wey inspire am, na im wey dey determine de destiny of man pikin. Our enemy dem dey wrong cos dem nor get de intuition wey dey guide our mind. Nor be dia fault true true, say as e concern dia class dem nor dey equipped with proletarian logic and ideology don blind dem. De decrees of history wey nor dey fathomable, wey don elect us don cos wahala for dem. Na we get de future.
