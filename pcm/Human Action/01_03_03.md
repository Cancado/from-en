### De Praxeological Side of Polylogism

One ideology for de Marxian sense of dis term na doctrine wey dey, although e get error from de point of view  of de correct  logic of de proletarians, dey beneficial to de selfish interests of de class wey develop am. An ideology dey objectively vicious, but e dey further de interest of de class of de thinker precisely in account of im viciousness. Many Marxians believe say dem don prove dis tenet by stressing de point say people nor dey thirst for knowledge only for im own sake. De aim of de scientist na to pave way for successful action. Dem dey always develop theories with view to practical application. Notin dey like pure science and de disinterested search for de truth.

For de sake of argument we fit admit say every effort to attain de truth dey motivated by consideration of im practical utilization for de attainment of some end. But dis nor answer de question why an "ideological" -- as in, a false theory go render service pass de one wey dey correct. De fact say de practical application of a theory results in de outcome wey dey predicted on de basis of dis theory na universally considered confirmation of im correctness. E dey paradoxical make we assert say vicious theory dey from any point of view more useful pass de correct one.

Men dey use firearms. If dem wan improve dis weapon, dem develop the science of ballistics. But, of cos, precisely cos dem dey eager to hunt a game and to kill demsef, a correct ballistics. A merely "ideological" ballistics nor go get any use. 

For de Marxians de view say scientists dey labor for knowledge na northing but "arrogant pretense" of de scientists. Thus, dem declare say dem lead Maxwell to im theory of electromagnetic waves by de craving of business for wireless telegraphs. [^6] impell Maxwell make e formulate correct theory for an ideological superstructure of de selfish class of the bourgeoisie. Doubt nor dey say bacterial research dey instigated nor be only by de desire to fight contagious disease but by de desire of de producer of wine and of cheese make dem improve dia methods of production. But de result wey dem obtain nor dey "ideological" for Marxian sense

De thing wey induce Marx make e  invent im ideology-doctrine na de wish to sap de prestige of economics. He dey fully aware of im impotence make e refute de objection wey dem economists raise to de practicability of de socialist schemes. In fact e dey so fascinated by de theoretical system of British classical economics wey he firmly believe for im impregnability. E either nor learn about de doubts say de classic theory of value wey dem raise for de mind of judicious scholars, abi, if ever hear about dem, e nor comprehend dia weight. Im own economic ideas dey hardly more than garbled version of Richardianism. When Jevons and Menger inaugurate new era of economic thought, im career as an author of economic writing don already come to an end; dem don already publish de first volume of Das Kapital several years previously. De only reaction wey Marx get to de marginal value theory na say e postpone de publication of de later volume of im main treatise. Dem make dem accessible to de public only after im death.

If dem wan develop de ideology-doctrine, Marx exclusively aim de economics and de social philosophy of utilitarianism. Im only intention na to destroy de reputation of economic teachings wey e dey unable to refute by means of logic and ratiocination. E give im doctrine de form of universal law wey dey valid for de whole historical age of social classes cos dem nor fit consider statement wey dey applicable to only one individual historical event as a law. For de same reasons e nor restrict im validity to only economic thought, but e include every branch of knowledge.

De service wey bourgeois economics render to de bourgeoisie na two fold for Marx eyes. E aid dem first for dia fight against feudalism and royal despotism and den later again for dia fight against de proletarian class wey dey rise.  E provide rational and moral justification for capitalist exploitation. If we want use notion wey dem develop after Marx death describe am, na rationalization of de claims of de capitalists. [^8] De capitalist, for dia subconsciousness ashamed of de meaning greed wey dey motivate dia own conduct and anxious to avoid social disapproval, dey encourage dia sycophants, de economists, make dem proclaim doctrines wey fit rehabilitate dem for public opinion.

Now, recourse to de tori of rationalization  dey provide  psychological description of de incentives wey dey impell a man or a group of men make dem formulate theorem abi a whole theory. But e nor predicate anything about de validity abi invalidity of de theory advanced. If e dey proved say de theory concerned dey untenable, de notion of rationalization na psychological interpretation of de causes wey make dia authors dey liable to error. But if we nor dey for de position to find any fault for de theory advanced, nor appeal to de concept of rationalization fit possibly explode im validity. If na true say de economist get for dia subconsciousness nor design wey pass de one wey dem go take use justify de unfair claims of de capitalists, dia theories go nevertheless dey quite correct.   Means nor dey to take expose faulty theory other than to refute am by discursive reasoning and to substitute better theory for am. If we wan deal with de theorem of Pythagoras or with de theory of comparative cost, we nor dey interested for de psychological factors wey impell Pythagoras and Ricardo to construct dese theorems, although, dese things fit dey important for de historian and de biographer. For science de only question wey dey relevant na whether or not dese theorems fit stand de test of rational examination. De social abi racial background of dia authors dey beside de point.

Na fact say people in de pursuit of dia selfish interest try to use doctrines wey dey more or less universally accepted by public opinion. Moreover, they are eager to invent and to propagate doctrines which they could possibly use for furthering their own interests. But this does not explain why such doctrines, favoring the interests of a minority and contrary to the interests of the rest of the people, are endorsed by public opinion. No matter whether such "ideological" doctrines are the product of a "false consciousness," forcing a man to think unwittingly in a manner that serves the interests of his class, or whether they are the product of a purposeful distortion of truth, they must encounter the ideologies of other classes and try to supplant them. Then a rivalry between antagonistic ideologies emerges. The Marxians explain victory and defeat in such conflicts as an outcome of the interference of historical providence. Geist, the mythical prime mover, operates according to a definite plan. He leads mankind through various preliminary stages to the final bliss of socialism. Every stage is the product of a certain state of technology; all its other characteristics are the necessary ideological superstructure of this technological state. Geist causes man to bring about in due time the technological ideas adequate to the stage in which he lives, and to realize them. All the rest is an outgrowth of the state of technology. The hand-mill made feudal society; the steam-mill made capitalism.[^9] Human will and reason play only an ancillary role in these changes. The inexorable law of historical development forces men--independently of their wills--to think and to behave according to the patterns corresponding to the material basis of their age. Men fool themselves in believing that they are free to choose between various ideas and between what they call truth and error. They themselves do not think; it is historical providence that manifests itself in their thoughts.

This is a purely mystical doctrine. The only proof given in its support is the recourse of Hegelian dialectics. Capitalistic private property is the first negation of individual private property. It begets, with the inexorability of a law of nature, its own negation, namely common ownership of the means of production.[^10] It is an undeniable fact that there prevails an irreconcilable conflict of interests between those workers who are employed at union wage rates and those who remain unemployed because the enforcement of union rates prevents the demand for and the supply of labor from finding the appropriate price for meeting. It is no less true that the interests of the workers of the comparatively overpopulated countries and those of the comparatively underpopulated countries are antagonistic with regard to migration barriers. The statement that the interests of all proletarians uniformly require the substitution of socialism for capitalism is an arbitrary postulate of Marx and the other socialists. It cannot be proved by the mere assertion that the socialist idea is the emanation of proletarian thought and therefore certainly beneficial to the interests of the proletariat as such.

A popular interpretation of the vicissitudes of British foreign trade policies, based on the ideas of Sismondi, Frederick List, Marx, and the German Historical School, runs this way: In the second part of the eighteenth century and in the greater part of the nineteenth century the class interests of the British bourgeoisie required a free trade policy. Therefore British political economy elaborated a free trade doctrine, and the British manufacturers organized a popular movement which finally succeeded in abolishing protective tariffs. Then later conditions changed. The British bourgeoisie could no longer stand the competition of foreign manufacturing and badly needed protective tariffs. Consequently the economists substituted a theory of protection for the antiquated free trade ideology, and Great Britain returned to protectionism.

The first error in this interpretation is that it considers the "bourgeoisie" as a homogeneous class composed of members whose interests are identical. A businessman is always under the necessity of adjusting the conduct of his business to the institutional conditions of his country. In the long run he is, in his capacity as entrepreneur and capitalist, neither favored nor injured by tariffs or the absence of tariffs. He will turn to the production of those commodities which under the given state of affairs he can most profitably produce. What may hurt or further his short-run interests are only *changes* in the institutional setting. But such changes do not affect the various branches of business and the various enterprises in the same way and to the same extent. A measure that benefits one branch or enterprise may be detrimental to other branches or enterprises. What counts for a businessman is only a limited number of customs items. And with regard to these items the interests of various branches and firms are mostly antagonistic.

The interests of every branch or firm can be favored by all kinds of privileges granted to it by the government. But if privileges are granted to the same extent also to the other branches and firms, every businessman loses--not only in his capacity as consumer, but also in his capacity as buyer of raw materials, half-finished products, machines and other equipment--on the one hand as much as he profits on the other. Selfish group interests may impel a man to ask for protection for his own branch or firm. They can never motivate him to ask for universal protection for all branches or firms if he is not sure to be protected to a greater extent than the other industries or enterprises.

Neither were the British manufacturers from the point of view of their class concerns more interested in the abolition of the Corn Laws than other British citizens. The landowners were opposed to the repeal of these laws because a lowering of the prices for agricultural products reduced the rent of land. A special class interest of the manufacturers can only be construed on the basis of the long since discarded iron law of wages and the no less untenable doctrine that profits are an outcome of the exploitation of the workers.

Within a world organized on the basis of the division of labor, every change must in one way or another affect the short-run interests of many groups. It is therefore always easy to expose every doctrine supporting an alteration of existing conditions as an "ideological" disguise of the selfish interests of a special group of people. The main occupation of many present-day authors is such unmasking. Marx did not invent this procedure. It was known long before him. Its most curious manifestation was the attempts of some eighteenth-century writers to explain religious creeds as a fraudulent deception on the part of the priests eager to gain power and wealth both for themselves and for their allies, the exploiters. The Marxians endorsed this statement in labeling religion "opium for the masses."[^12] It never occurred to the supporters of such teachings that where there are selfish interests pro there must necessarily be selfish interests contra too. It is by no means a satisfactory explanation of any event that it favored a special class. The question to be answered is why the rest of the population whose interests it injured did not succeed in frustrating the endeavors of those favored by it.

Every firm and every branch of business is in the short run interested in increased sales of its products. In the long run, however, there prevails a tendency toward an equalization of returns in the various branches of production. If demand for the products of a branch increases and raises profits, more capital flows into it and the competition of the new enterprises cuts down the profits. Returns are by no means higher in the sale of socially detrimental articles than in the sale of socially beneficial articles. If a certain branch of business is outlawed and those engaged in it risk prosecution, penalties, and imprisonment, gross profits must be high enough to compensate for the risks involved. But this does not interfere with the height of net returns.

The rich, the owners of the already operating plants, have no particular class interest in the maintenance of free competition. They are opposed to confiscation and expropriation of their fortunes, but their vested interests are rather in favor of measures preventing newcomers from challenging their position. Those fighting for free enterprise and free competition do not defend the interests of those rich today. They want a free hand left to unknown men who will be the entrepreneurs of tomorrow and whose ingenuity will make the life of coming generations more agreeable. They want the way left open to further economic improvements. They are the spokesmen of material progress.

The nineteenth-century success of free trade ideas was effected by the theories of classical economics. The prestige of these ideas was so great that those whose selfish class interests they hurt could not hinder their endorsements by public opinion and their realization by legislative measures. It is ideas that make history, and not history that makes ideas.

It is useless to argue with mystics and seers. They base their assertions on intuition and are not prepared to submit them to rational examination. The Marxians pretend that what their inner voice proclaims is history's self-revelation. If other people do not hear this voice, it is only a proof that they are not chosen. It is insolence that those groping in darkness dare to contradict the inspired ones. Decency should impel them to creep into a corner and keep silent.

However, science cannot abstain from thinking although it is obvious that it will never succeed in convincing those who dispute the supremacy of reason. Science must emphasize that the appeal to intuition cannot settle the question which of several antagonistic doctrines is the right one and which are wrong. It is an undeniable fact that Marxism is not the only doctrine advanced in our time. There are other "ideologies" besides Marxism. The Marxians assert that the application of these other doctrines would hurt the interests of the many. But the supporters of these doctrines say precisely the same with regard to Marxism.

Of course, the Marxians consider a doctrine vicious if its author's background is not proletarian. But who is proletarian? Doctor Marx, the manufacturer and "exploiter" Engels, and Lenin, the scion of the Russian gentry, were certainly not of proletarian background. But Hitler and Mussolini were genuine proletarians and spent their youth in poverty. The conflict of the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks or that between Stalin and Trotsky cannot be presented as class conflicts. They were conflicts between various sects of fanatics who called one another traitors.

The essence of Marxian philosophy is this: We are right because we are the spokesmen of the rising proletarian class. Discursive reasoning cannot invalidate our teachings, for they are inspired by the supreme power that determines the destiny of mankind. Our adversaries are wrong because they lack the intuition that guides our minds. It is, of course, not their fault that on account of their class affiliation they are not equipped with the genuine proletarian logic and are blinded by ideologies. The unfathomable decrees of history that have elected us have doomed them. The future is ours.
