### De Prerequisites De Actions Wey Humans Dey Take

We call contentment or satisfaction say state of a human being wey nor and wey nor fit result in any action. Acting man dey eager to substitute state affairs wey dey more satisfactory for de one wey dey less satisfactory. Im kind dey imagine de thing wey suit am beta, and im action dey aim to bring about de desired state. De incentive wey impel a man make im always act na always uneasiness [^1]. A man wey dey perfectly content with de state of im affairs nor go get incentive make e change things. E nor go get wishes abi desires; e go dey perfectly happy. E nor go act; e go simple live from free care.

But to do make man act, uneasiness and de image of a more satisfactory state alone nor dey sufficient. A third condition dey required:  de expectation say purposeful behaviour get de power to remove abi at least make e alleviate de uneasiness wey dem feel. For de absence of dis condition, nor action dey feasible. Man must yield to de inevitable. E must submit to destiny.

Dese na de general conditions of human action. Man na de being wey dey live under dis conditions. Nor be only homo sapiens e be, and nor be less homo agents. Beings of human decent wey be say na from birth abi from acquired defect dey unchangeably unfit for any action (in de strict sense of de term and nor be only for de legal sense) dey practically not human. Although de statutes and biology consider say dem be men, dey lack de essential feature of humanity. De newborn baby too nor be acting being. E neva go de whole way from conception to de full development of im human qualities. But for de end of im evolution, e go become acting being. 

#### On Top Happiness

For colloquial speech, we dey call  man "happy" if im don succeed to attain im ends. A more adequate description of im state be say e dey happy pass de way e dey before. Nor valid objection dey to de usage wey define human action as de striving for happiness.

But we must to avoid current misunderstandings. De ultimate goal of human action na to always satisfy de acting man's desire. Standard of greater abi lesser satisfaction nor dey other dan individual judgement of value, wey dey different for various people and for de same people for various times. De thing wey make man make e dey  feel uneasy abi less uneasy dey established by am from de standard of im own will and judgement, from im personal and im subjective valuation. Norbody dey for de position to decree wetin go make im fellow man happy.

To establish dis fact nor refer  in any way to de antitheses of egoism and altruism, of materialism and idealism, of individualism and collectivism, of atheism and religion. People dey wey be say dia only aim na to improve  Dr condition  of dia own ego. People dey wey be say awareness of dia fellow men dey causes plenty uneasiness pass dia own wants. People dey wey desire nothing pass de satisfaction of dia appetite for sexual intercourse, food, drinks, fine homes, and other material things. But other men care more for de satisfaction wey dem commonly call "higher" and "ideal". Individuals dey wey dey eager dia action for de requirements of social cooperation; e get some refractory people wey defy de rules of social life for another hand. People dey wey be say dia ultimate goal of de earthly pilgrimage na to prepare for a life of bliss. People dey wey nor believe for de teachings of any religion and dem nor dey allow dia actions make e influence dem.

Praxeology dey indifferent to de ultimate goals of action. Im findings dey valid for a kinds of actions irrespective of de ends wey dem aim at. Na science of means e be, nor be ends. E apply de term happiness for sense wey dey purely formal. For de praxeological terminology de proposition: man's unique aim na to attain happiness, dey tautological. E nor imply any statement about de state of affairs wia man expect happiness from.

De idea say de incentive of human activity na always some uneasiness and  im aim na  to always  remove  dat kin uneasiness as far  as possible, as in,  to make de acting men to dey feel happy, na de essence of de teachings of Eudaemonism and Hedonism. Epicurean ἀταραξία na dat state of perfect happiness and contentment wey all human activity aim without say dem go attain am. For de face of de grandeur of dis cognition be de little avail only say many representative of dis philosophy fail to recognise de purely formal character of de notions pain and pleasure and come give dem material and carnal meaning. De theological, mystical, and other schools of a heteronomous ethic nor shake de core of Epicureanism cos dem nor fit raise any other objection pass de neglect of de "higher" and "nobler" pleasures. Na true say Dr writings of many earlier champions of Eudaemonism, Hedonism, and Utilitarianism  dey open to misinterpretation for some points. But de language of modern philosophers and still more dan de modern economists dey so precise and straightforward to de extent say misinterpretation fit occur.

#### On Top Instincts and Impulse mata

Person nor fit further de comprehension of de fundamental problem of human action by de methods of instinct-sociology. Dis school come clarify de various concrete goals of human action and assign each class to im own motive. Man appears as a being wey dey driven by various innate instincts and dispositions. Dem assume say dis explanation demolishes once and for all de odious teachings wey dey economics and utilitarian ethics. However, Feuerbach don already justly observe say every instinct na instinct to happiness [^2]. De method of knstinct-psychology and instinct-sociology consists for an arbitrary classification of de immediate goals of action and in a hypostasis of each. Whereas praxeology talk say de goal of an action na to remove a certain uneasiness, instinct-psychology talk say na de satisfaction of an instinctive urge.

Many champions of the instinct school are convinced that they have proved that action is not determined by reason, but stems from the profound depths of innate forces, impulses, instincts, and dispositions which are not open to any rational elucidation. They are certain they have succeeded in exposing the shallowness of rationalism and disparage economics as "a tissue of false conclusions drawn from false psychological assumptions."[^3]

He who acts under an emotional impulse also acts. What distinguishes an emotional action from other actions is the valuation of input and output. Emotions disarrange valuations. Inflamed with passion, man sees the goal as more desirable and the price he has to pay for it as less burdensome than he would in cool deliberation. Men have never doubted that even in the state of emotion means and ends are pondered and that it is possible to influence the outcome of this deliberation by rendering more costly the yielding to the passionate impulse. To punish criminal offenses committed in a state of emotional excitement or intoxication more mildly than other offenses is tantamount to encouraging such excesses. The threat of severe retaliation does not fail to deter even people driven by seemingly irresistible passion.

We interpret animal behavior on the assumption that the animal yields to the impulse which prevails at the moment. As we observe that the animal feeds, cohabits, and attacks other animals or men, we speak of its instincts of nourishment, of reproduction, and of aggression. We assume that such instincts are innate and peremptorily ask for satisfaction.

But is different with man. Man is not a being who cannot help yielding to the impulse that most urgently asks for satisfaction. Man is a being capable of subduing his instincts, emotions, and impulses; he can rationalize his behavior. He renounces the satisfaction of a burning impulse in order to satisfy other desires. He is not a puppet of his appetites. A man does not ravish every female that stirs his senses; he does not devour every piece of food that entices him; he does not knock down every fellow he would like to kill. He arranges his wishes and desires into a scale, he chooses; in short, he acts. What distinguishes man from beasts is precisely that he adjusts his behavior deliberatively. Man is the being that has inhibitions, that can master his impulses and desires, that has the power to suppress instinctive desires and impulses.

It may happen that an impulse emerges with such vehemence that no disadvantage which its satisfaction may cause appears great enough to prevent the individual from satisfying it. In this case too there is choosing. Man decides in favor of yielding to the desire concerned.[^5]
