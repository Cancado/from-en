### De Restoration of Morality: On Liberation

Wetin we for do? Rothbard don not only reconstruct de ethics of liberty and explain de current morass as de result of statism; e don also show us de way toward a restoration of morals dem. 

First and foremost, e don explain say states, as powerful and invincible as dem fit be, ultimately owe dem existence to ideas, and since ideas fit change instantaneously in principle, dem fit bring down and practically crumble states overnight.

De representatives of de state dey everywhere always just be one small minority of de total population on top wich dem dey rule. De reason for dis ting dey simple as em dey fundamental sef: one hundred parasites fit live comfortable lives if dem suck out de life blood of thousands of productive hosts, but thousands of parasites no fit live comfortably off on top a population of just a hundred. Yet, if government agents just merely be one small minority of de population, how dem go fit enforce dem will on top dis population make dem still get away wit am? De answer wey Rothbard and de la Boétie, Hume, and Mises before am be only say na by virtue of de voluntary cooperation of de majority of de subject population wit de state. Yet how de state go fit secure dat kin cooperation? De answer na only becos and insofar as de majority of de population believe de legitimacy wey state rule get. Dis no be to say dat de majority of de population gat agree wit all of de state measure wey dey. Indeed, e fit come believe say many of de kin state policies dey mistaken or despicable. Howeva, de majority of de population gat believe in de justice of de state like dat, and hence, dat even if one particular government go wrong, dis mistakes merely be accidents wey dem gat accept and tolerate in view of some greater good wey de institution of government provide.

Yet, how we go make de majority of de population to believe dis? De answer dey wit de help of de intellectuals. For de old days e go mean to dey try to hold an alliance between de state and de church. For de modern times and far more effectively, dis mean say through de nationalization (socialization) of education: through de state-run or state-subsidized schools and universities. De market demand for intellectual services, in particular in de area of de humanities and social sciences, is not exactly high and none too stable and secure. Intellectuals go be at de mercy of de values and choices of de masses dem, and generally de masses nor dey interested in intellectual philosophical concerns. De state, on de oder hand, notes Rothbard, accommodate dem typically conflated egos and “dey willing to offer de intellectuals a warm, secure, and permanent berth for dem apparatus, a secure income, and de panoply of prestige”. Indeed, de modern democratic state in particular, don create one massive oversupply of intellectuals.

Dis accomomodation nor guarantee “correct” – statist- thinking, of course; and as well and generally overpaid as dem be, intellectuals go continue to dey complain of how little dem oh-so-important work dey dey appreciated by dose wey dem power pass power. But e certainly dey help to dey reach de “correct” conclusions if one realize say without de state- de institutions of taxation and legislation- peson fit lose em work and start to dey try hands for de mechanics of gas pump operation instead of to dey emself wit pressing problems like alienation, equity, exploitation, de construction of gender and sex roles, or de culture of dem Eskimos, de Hopis, and de Zulus. Furthermore, even if peson dey underappreciated by dis or dat incumbent government, peson go still realise say help only fit come from another government like dat. Thus, e nor dey too surprising say, as matter of empirical fact, de overwhelming majority of contemporary intellectuals dey far-out left and even say most of de conservative or free market intellectuals such as Friedman or Hayek dem, for instance, be fundamentally and philosophically statists. 

From dis insight into de importance of ideas and de role of intellectuals as bodyguards of de state and statism, e mean say  de most decisive role wey dey de process of liberation—the restoration of justice and morality—gats fall on de shoulders of wetin person fit call anti-intellectual intellectuals. Yet how dat kind  anti-intellectual intellectuals go fit succeed in delegitimizing de state in public opinion, especially if de overwhelming majority of dia colleagues na statists and dem go do everytin wey dem fit do to isolate and discredit dem as extremists and crackpots? Time go just allow just small short comments ontop dis important  question.

First, person get to reckon wit de vicious opposition from one’s colleagues.  to fit stand am,e dey very important to support de case with ethics and moral arguments, make e nor be economics and utilitarianism, becos na only moral convictions go fit provide person with de courage and strength wey dey needed in ideological battle. Few dey inspired and willing to accept sacrifices if wetin dem dey opposed to  na just small error and waste. More inspiration and courage fit dey drawn from to know say person dey fight evil and lies. ( I go come back to dis mata very soon). 

Second, e dey important to recognize say person nor gats convert im colleagues, dat is, to change dem make dem be mainstream intellectuals. As Thomas Kuhn don show, dis one dey rare enough even in de natural sciences. In de social sciences, conversions among established intellectuals from previously held views na sometin wey we nor dey hear of. Instead, person suppose concentrate  im efforts ontop de young people wey never dey intellectually commited, wey idealism dey make dem also particularly receptive to moral arguments and moral rigorism. Also, person gats try educate de general public dat is de laymen, wey go entertain some kind anti-intellectual prejudices wey person fit tap from easily. 

Third, make I return to de importance of  moral attack on de state, e dey important to know say compromise on the level of theory fit dey. To dey sure, person nor gats  refuse to cooperate wit people wey dey ultimately mistaken and confused, as far as say dia objectives fit dey classified clearly and unambiguously as a step in de right direction of de de-statization of society. For example, person nor go wan refuse cooperation wit people wey wan introduce a flat income tax of 10 percent (although person nor go wan cooperate wit dose wey go wan combine dis measure wit increased sales tax, so dem go fit achieve revenue neutrality, for example). But, make e nor be say dat kind cooperation go lead to or go make compromising person principles come enta. Either taxation na just or e nor dey just. Once e don dey accepted as just, how person go come dey to oppose increase? de answer be say person nor fit!

If we put am differently, compromise on de level of theory as we find am, for example, among moderate free-marketeers like Hayek or Friedman or even among de so-called minarchists,  nor dey only philosophically flawed but e follow dey practically ineffective and indeed counterproductive. dia ideas fit dey–and infact dey co-opted and incorporated by de state rulers and statist ideology. Infact, how many times wey we dey hear from statists dis days and in defense of person wey get statist agenda cries like "even  Hayek (Friedman) says”, or, “not even Hayek (Friedman) denies dat such and such gats dey done by de state”! Personally, dem fit nor dey happy about dis but dem nor fit lie say dia work dey help dis purpose and so dem nor fit tok say dem bin contribute de continued and unabated  growth of state power.

In oda words, theoretical compromise or gradualism go only lead to de  perpetuation of de falsehood, evils, and lies of statism, and only theoretical purism, radicalism, and intransigence go fit and go lead first to gradual practical reform and improvement and den maybe to final victory. Accordingly, as person wey be anti-intellectual intellectual in de Rothbardian sense, person nor fit dey satisfied to dey criticize different kind government palava though person gats start like dis, but person gats continue from dere to a fundamental attack  on de institution of de state as moral outrage and im representative as moral and also economic frauds, liars, and impostors-as emperors wey nor get clothes. 

To dey specific, person no gats think am wen e wan strike at de heart of de legitimacy of de state: wey be de indispensable  role as producer of private protection and security. I don already show how funny dis claim dey if we dey tok theory: how agency wey fit expropriate private property go  dey claim say im be protector of private property? E dey less important to dey attack de legitimacy of de state in dis regard on empirical grounds by to dey point out say states, wey suppose protect us, na dem dey responsible for almost 170million deaths in dis twentieth century alone-wey plenty pass de victims of private crime in de whole human history!And dis numba of victims of private crime, wey government suppose protect us from, suppose dey lower if de governments everywhere and everytime bin nor disarm dia citizen so de government go dey better as effective killing machines.

Instead make we treat politicians wit respect, den our criticism of dem gats dey  increased. Almost to man, dem nor just be thieves dem be mass murderers.  How dem go dey demand our loyalty and respect?

But sharp and distinct ideological radicalization go bring de  results wey we want? I nor get doubt. Infact only radical and radically simple ideas na im fit change de emotions of de dull and indolent masses and delegitimize  government in dia eyes. 

Make I quote Hayek for here (and as I dey do like dis, I  wan show say my harsh criticism of him, mek e nor dey misunderstood say wetin e mean be say person nor fit  learn anytin from  authors wey dey  fundamentally wrong and muddled):

> We must to make de building of free society once more de kind adventure wey dey intellectual, and one deed wey get courage. Wetin we lack na liberal Utopia, a programme wey nor seem like mere defence of tings as dem be and dem nor be diluted kind of socialism too, but truly be liberal radicalism wey nor spare de susceptibilities of de mighty…wey nor too dey severely practical and wey nor confine eself to wetin appear today as politically possible. We need intellectual leaders dem wey dey prepared to resist de blandishments of power and influence and wey dey willing to work for one ideal, howeva small de prospects of em early realization. Dem gat be men wey dey wan stick to principles and to fight for dem full realization, howeva remote. …Free trade and freedom of opportunity be ideas wey still fit raise de imaginations of large numbers, but one mere “reasonable freedom of trade” or one mere “relaxation of controls” nor dey intellectually respectable and e nor dey likely to inspire any enthusiasm….
>
> Unless say we fit make de philosophic foundations of a free society make e be  living intellectual issue, and im implementation a task wey go challenge de ingenuity and imagination of our liveliest minds, de prospects of freedom dey very dark. But if we fit regain dat belief in de power of ideas wey bin be de Mark of liberalism, de battle nor dey  lost.

Hayek bin nor follow im own advice and im nor provide us theory wey dey consistent and inspiring. im Utopia, wey bin de Constitution of liberty, na im be de uninspiring vision of de Swedish welfare state. Instead na Rothbard wey don do wetin Hayek bin see say dey important for renewal of a classical liberalism; and if anytin dey wey fit reverse de tide of statism wey be like say e nor fit stop and restore justice and liberty, na de personal example wey Murray Rothbard don set and how Rothbardism don spread.
