### How Dem Restore Morality: On Top Liberation

Na wetin we go do now?, Rothbard nor only reconstruct de ethics of liberty and explain de current morass as de result of statism; im follow show us de way on how we fit carry restore morals. 

First thing be say, im don explain say states as e be like say dem dey very powerful and invincible, say dem owe dia existence to ideas, and since ideas fit change anytime, states fit dey down or dem fit scatter ova nite. 

De representatives of de state dey always dey everywhere and na only small minority of de population wey dem dey rule. de reason for dis dey simple as e dey fundamental: one hundred parasites fit live comfortable lives if dem dey suck out de life blood of thousands of people wey get blood, but thousands of parasites nor fit live comfortably off of a host population wey be just hundred. Yet if government agents na just small minority of the population, how dem go fit enforce dia will on dis population and still dey free? de answer wey Rothbard give as well as de  la Boetie, Hume, and Mises before him na just becos of de voluntary cooperation of de majority of de subject population wit de state. Yet how de state go fit secure dat kind cooperation? de answer na only becos say and so far say de majority of de population believe say de state rule dey legit. Dis one nor mean say de majority gats gree wit every single state measure. Indeed, e fit be say many state policies dey mistaken. But de majority of de population gats believe in de justice of de institution of de state and so dat even if one particular government don do wrong, dis mistakes go just be accident wey must dey accepted and tolerated as dem dey expect beta wey de institution of government go provide. 

Yet how dem go fit bring de majority of de population to believe dis one? na with de help of intellectual people be de answer. For de olden days e mean to try to form alliance with de state and de church. For modern time and as e effective wella, e mean say na through de nationalization (socialization) of education: through state-run or state-subsidized school dem and universities. De market dey ask for people wey get intellectual, for de area of humanities  and social sciences in particular, e nor too high and none dey too stable and secure. Intellectuals dem go dey at de mercy of de value and de choices of de country people, and for general mata de country people nor get interest for intellectualphilosophical concern. De state, for de oda hand, as  Rothbard write, dem dey accommodate dia ego wey don over rise and "dey willing to offer de intellectual people warm, secure and permanent resting place for dia apparatus, income wey secure and de group of prestige". Indeed, de modern democratic state in particular don create massive oversupply of intellectual people.

Dis accommodation  nor guarantee “correct”—statist—thinking, of course; and as well and as dem dey generally overpaid , intellectuals go still dey complain of how little dia oh-so-important work dey appreciated by de powers wey dey. But e dey help to reach de “correct” conclusions if person realize say without de state—the institution of taxation and legislation—person fit dey out of work and fit  come dey try one’s hands at the mechanics of gas pump operation instead of to dey concern himself wit pressing problems like alienation, equity, exploitation, de deconstruction of gender and sex roles, or de culture of the Eskimos, the Hopis, and de Zulus. To add more, even if person dey feel say im dey underappreciated by dis or dat incumbent government, he go still realize say help go fit only come from anoda government, and e nor fit come from an intellectual assault on de legitimacy of de institution of government. So, e nor dey surprising say, as a mata of empirical fact, de overwhelming majority of contemporary intellectuals na far-out lefties and dat even some kind conservative or free market intellectuals like Friedman or Hayek, for example, na fundamentally and philosophically statists.

From dis insight into de importance wey ideas and de role wey intellectuals get as bodyguards for de state and statism, e follow say de most decisive role for de process wey liberation get- de restoration for justice and morality- gat fall on de shoulder of wetin peson fit call anti-intellectual intellectuals. Yet how such anti-intellectual intellectuals possibly fit succeed for delegitimizing de state for public opinion, especially if de overwhelming majority of dem colleagues be statists and dem go do everything foe dem power to isolate and discredit dem as extremists and crackpots? Time permits only one small short comments on dis fundamental question.

First, peson gat reckon wit the vicious opposition from peson colleagues. To withstand de opposition, e dey very important to ground peson case nor for economics and utilitarianism, but for ethics and moral arguments, cos na only moral convictions dey provide peson wit de courage and strength needed for ideological battle. Few dey inspired and willing to accept sacrifices if wetin dem dey opposed to be mere error and waste. E fit draw more inspiration and courage from knowing say e dey engaged for fighting of evil and lies. (I dey com back to dis shortly.)

Second, e dey important to recognize say peson nor need to convert peson colleagues, i.e., to persuade mainstream intellectuals. As Thomas Kuhn don show, e dey rare enough even for de natural sciences. For de social sciences, conversions among established intellectuals from previously held views dey almost unheard of. Instead, peson suppose concentrate em effort on de not-yet intellectually committed young, whose idealism dey make dem also particularly receptive to moral arguments and moral rigorism. Likewise, peson suppose circumvent academia and reach out to de general public (i.e., to de educated laymen), wich dey entertain some generally healthy anti-intellectual prejudices inside wich peson fit tap easily. 

Third, make we return to de importance of a moral attack on de state, e dey essential to recognize say more compromise on de level of theory nor fit dey. To dey sure, peson nor suppose refuse to cooperate wit people wey get views wey go dey ultimately mistaken and confused, *provided* say dem objectives fit dey classified clearly and objectively as step for de right direction of de de-statization of society. For instance, peson no go wan refuse cooperation wit people wey seek to introduce flat income tax of 10 percent (although peson no go wan cooperate wit those wey wan combine dis measure wit increased sales tax to achieve revenue neutrality for instance). Howeva, dat kin cooperation, under no circumstance, should lead to or be achieved by compromising peson principles. Either taxation dey just or e nor dey just. Once e don dey accepted as just, how peson go oppose any increase wey follow for inside? De answer definitely na peson nor fit!

If we put am differently, compromise for theory level, as we see am, for instance, among de so-called monarchists, nor only dey philosophically flawed but e dey also practically ineffective and indeed counterproductive. Dem ideas fit be – and in fact dey – easily co-opted and incorporated by de state rulers and statist ideology. Indeed, how often we dey hear nowadays from statists and in defense of statist agenda cries like “even Hayek (Friedman) say”, or, “nor even be Hayek (Friedman) deny dat de state gat do one ting one ting”! Personally, dem fit nor dey happy about de ting, but we nor fit deny am say dem work lend eself fro dis purpose, and hence, say dem actually contributed to de continued and unabated growth wey state power get.

In oder words, theoretical compromise or gradualism go only lead to de perpetuation of de falsehood, evils, and lies of statism, and only theoretical purism, radicalism, and intransigence fit and go lead first to gradual practical reform and improvement and then possibly to final victory. Accordingly, as anti-intellectual in de Rothbardian sense, peson nor go fit dey satisfied wit criticizing various government follies although peson fit gat begin wit dis, but peson still gat always proceed from there to fundamental attack on de institution of de state as moral outrage and e representatives as moral frauds, economic frauds, liars, and impostors – and as emperors without clothe.  

Specifically, peson must never hesitate to strike at de heart of de legitimacy of de state: e alleged indispensable role as producer of private protection and security. I don already show how ridiculous dis claim be on theoretical grounds: how one agency wey fit expropriate private property possibly claim to be protector of private property? E dey hardly less important to attack  de legitimacy of de state in dis regard on empirical grounds by pointing out and hammering at de fact dat states wey suppose dey protect us, be de very institutions responsible for an estimated 170 million deaths for twentieth century alone – more than de victims of private crime for all of human history! And dis number of victims of private crime, wey government nor protect us from, for dey very low if say government everywhere and every time nor undertake constant effort to disarm dem own citizens so dat  de governments in turn go fit become ever more effective as killing machines.

Instead to dey treat politicians wit respect, then peson criticism of dem fit dey dey significantly stepped up. Almost to one man, dem nor only be thieves but mass murderers too. How dare dem demand our respect and loyalty?

But shey one sharp and distinct ideological radicalization go bring de desired result? I get one doubt. Indeed, only radical and indeed radically simple ideas go fit possibly stir de emotions of de dull and indolent masses and delegitimize government for dem eyes.

Make I quote Hayek for dis matter ( and as I dey do dis ting, I hope say I indicate say my rather harsh criticism from befor of hayek nor mean say make you misunderstand am for say peson no fit learn anything from authors wey dey fundamentally wrong and muddled):

> We gat make de building of free society once more an adventure wey dey intellectual, and one deed wey get courage. Wetin we lack na liberal Utopia, a programme wey nor seem like mere defence of tings as dem be and dem nor be diluted kind of socialism too, but truly be liberal radicalism wey nor spare de susceptibilities of de mighty…wey nor too dey severely practical and wey nor confine eself to wetin appear today as politically possible. We need intellectual leaders dem wey dey prepared to resist de blandishments of power and influence and wey dey willing to work for one ideal, howeva small de prospects of em early realization. Dem gat be men wey dey wan stick to principles and to fight for dem full realization, howeva remote. …Free trade and freedom of opportunity be ideas wey still fit raise de imaginations of large numbers, but one mere “reasonable freedom of trade” or one mere “relaxation of controls” nor dey intellectually respectable and e nor dey likely to inspire any enthusiasm….
>
> Unless we fit make de philosophic foundations of free society once more one intellectual issue, and em implementation one task wey go challenge de ingenuity and imagination of our liveliest minds, de prospects of freedom indeed dey dark. But if we fit regain dat belief in de power of ideas wey be de mark of liberalism at em best, de battle never dey lost. [^2]

Hayek nor heed em own advice to provide us wit one consistent and inspiring theory. Em Utopia, as developed for em Constitution of Liberty, na de rather uninspiring vision wey de Swedish welfare state get. Instead, na Rothbard wey don do wetin Hayek recognized as necessary for one renewal of classical liberalism; and if nothin dey wey fit reverse the seemingly unstoppable tide of statism and restore justice and liberty, na de personal example set by Murray Rothbard and de spread of Rothbardianism.
