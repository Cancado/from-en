### Mula sa Kalakal na Salapi sa Piyat na Salapi: Ang Tungkulin ng Salapi

Kung ang salapi ay kailangang umangat bilang isang kalakal na salapai, paano ito magiging piyat na salapi? Ginagawa ito sa pamamagitan ng pagpapaunlad ng mga pamalit ng salapi (ang mga pamagat ng papel na salapi ng kalakal)-pero ito lamang ang mapanlinlang at tanging sa presyo ng mga pang-ekonomikang kawalan ng kakayahan.

Sa ilalim ng pamantayan na salapi ng kalakal tulad ng pamantayan nang ginto hanggang sa taong 1914, ang salapi ay "lumaganap" sa isang banda sa anyo ng mga pamantayan na bar ng bulyon at gintong barya ng iba't-ibang denominasyon na kalakalan laban sa isa't-isa sa mga kinakailangang naayos na tumbasan ayon sa kanilang timbang at kabutihan. Sa kabilang banda, upang mapangalagaan ang halaga ng pag-iimbak (pag-iingat) at pamamalakad (pag-lilinis) ng salapi, sa isang pag-unlad na katulad ng mga naililipat na mga titulo ng ari-arian-kabilang ang mga sertipiko ng nakaimbak at bono-bilang paraan ng pagpapakilos sa malapad at lumilipas na palitan ng hindi na salaping kalakal, magkakasunod sa tamang salapi din ang mga sertipiko ng ginto-mga pamagat ng ari-arian (ang mga pagkuha) sa tinukoy na halaga ng ginto na idineposito sa tinukoy na mga institusyon (mga bangko)-naglilingkod bilang daluyan ng palitan. Ang magkakasamang mabuhay sa tamang salapi (ginto) at mga kapalit ng salapi (ang mga kinuha na salapi) ay hindi nakakaapekto sa kabuuang panustos ng salapi-para sa anumang sertipiko na ipinapadala sa isang sirkulasyon na isang katumbas na halaga ng ginto ay kinuha mula sa sirkulasyon (idineposito)-hindi ang interpersonal na kita at kayamanan pamamahagi. Ganunpaman nang walang alinlangan ang magkakasamang buhay ng salapi at mga kapalit ng pera at ang posibilidad na humawak ng salapi sa alinmang anyo at sa mga halaga na kumbinasyon ng mga naturang anyo ay bumubuo ng dagdag na kaginhawahan sa mga indibidwal na kalahok sa merkado. Ito ay kung paano ang mga walang kapararakan na mga piraso ng papel ay maaaring makakuha ng kapangyarihan sa pagbili. Kung at sa kabilang banda na ito ay kumakatawan sa isang walang pasubaling pagkuha sa salapi at kung at sa kasong walang alinlangan umiiral na sila ay may bisa at maaaring sa katunayan ay matutubos sa anumang oras, papel tiket ay binili at ibinebenta na parang sila ay tunay na pera-ang mga ito ay pagpapalitan laban sa salapi at sa par. Sa sandaling nakakuha na sila ng kapangyarihan sa pagbili at pagkatapos ay pinagkaitan ng kanilang pagkatao bilang mga pag-angkin sa salapi (sa pamamagitan ng pagsususpinde sa pag-kuha), maaari silang magpatuloy sa paggana bilang salapi. Tulad ng isinulat ni Mises:

> Bago magsimula ang isang pang-ekonomikang kabutihan upang gumana bilang salapi ito ay dapat na nagtataglay ng halaga ng palitan batay 
sa iba pang dahilan kaysa sa monetary function nito. Pero ang salapi na tungkulin na tulad ay maaaring manatiling mahalaga kahit na ang 
orihinal na pinagmulan ng halaga ng palitan nito ay hindi na umiiral.[^9]

[^9]: Si Mises sa, Ang Teorya ng Salapi at Kredito, p. 111.

Ganunpaman, nais ng mga taong sa kanila lang sariling interes na alisin ang mga tiket na papel sa kanilang karakter bilang mga pamagat sa salapi? Gusto nilang mag-suspende ng pagbawi sa kakayahan at magpatibay ng walang kuwenta sa walang halaga na papel bilang salapi? 
Ang mga kampanyang salapi ng salapi tulad ni Milton Friedman ay nag-aangkin na ito ang kaso, at kadalasan ay binibigyan nila ng motibo 
ang pagtitipid bilang dahilan sa pagpapalit ng piyat para sa kalakal na salapi: Ang isang pamantayan ng ginto ay nagsasangkot ng panlipunang basura sa pag-aatas ng pagmimina at minting ng ginto. Ang mga potensyal na mapagkukunan ay kailangang italaga sa produksyon ng salapi.[^10] Sa mahalagang gastos ng mas kaunting salapi sa halip na ginto, ang naturang basura ay mawawala, at ang mga mapagkukunan ay mapapalaya para sa produksyon ng direktang kapaki-pakinabang na prodyuser o mga kalakal ng mamimili. Ito ay kaya isang mas mataas na pang-ekonomiyang kahusayan sa piyat ng salapi na nagpapaliwanag sa pangkalahatang pag-abandona ng kasalukuyang mundo ng pera sa kalakal. Ngunit ito ba? Ang tagumpay ba ng piyat ng salapai ay ang katuparan ng ilang hindi nakapipinsalang pagtitipid? Ito ba ay maaaring maiisip na maaaring ito? Maaari bang mai-save ng mga interesado sa sarili na interesado ang mga kampeon ng salapi ng poker na ipalagay na ginagawa nila?

[^10]: Makikita si Friedman sa, "Ang Mga Sanaysay sa Positibong Ekonomika sa, p. 210; idem, Isang Programa para sa Katatagan ng Pananalapi, pp. 4-8; idem, Kapitalismo at Kalayaan (Chicago: Unibersidad ng Chicago Press, Taong 1962), p. 40.

Ang mas kaunting paglilitis ay nagpapakita na ito ay imposible, at ang institusyon ng piyat na salapi ay nangangailangan ng pag-uumpisa ng isang napaka-iba't ibang-hindi hindi nakapipinsala pero masamang motibo: Ipagpalagay ang isang ekonomikong salapi na may (kahit na) 
isang bangko at tamang salapi ("sa labas ng salapu" sa modernong pag-uusap) pati na rin ang mga pamalit sa salapi ("sa loob ng salapi") sa sirkulasyon. Kung nais ng mga kalahok sa merkado na itabi ang mga gastusin ng mapagkukunan ng isang salapi sa kalakal (na may pangwakas na layunin ng pag-demonyo ng ginto at salapi ng salapi), inaasahan ng isa na unang-bilang isang humigi kumulan sa layuning ito-nais nilang palayain ang paggamit ng anumang nasa labas salapi (ginto). Ang lahat ng mga transaksyon ay dapat na isagawa sa loob ng salapi (papel), at ang lahat ng salapi sa labas ay dapat ideposito sa isang bangko at sa gayo'y mawawalan ng sirkulasyon (Kung hindi man, hangga't ang sirang pera ay nasa sirkulasyon pa rin, ang mga taong gumagawa ang paggamit ng mga gintong barya ay nagpapakita ng hindi mapagkakatiwalaan-sa pamamagitan ng kanilang mga kilos-na hindi nila nais na itabi sa mga nauugnay na gastos sa mapagkukunan.)

Ganunpaman, posible ba na ang mga kapalit na salapi ay maaaring makapagpaligsahan at magpalit ng tunay na salapi bilang isang daluyan ng palitan? Kahit na maraming matapang na teoritikan para sa salapi ay masyadong mabilis na umamin tulad ng isang posibilidad. Ang dahilan dito ay ang mga pamalit ng salapi ay mga pamalit at may isang permanenteng at hindi mapagkakatiwalaang kawalan kung ihahambing sa tamang salapi. Ang mga tala ng papel (ang mga pagkuha sa salapi) ay maaaring mabayaran sa par lamang kung ang bayad sa deposito ay binayaran 
sa institusyong nagdeposito. Ang pagbibigay ng pagbabantay at paglilinis ng mga serbisyo ay isang magaan na negosyo, at ang isang 
deposito ay ang presyo na binabayaran para sa nababantayan na salapi. Kung ang mga tala ng papel ay iniharap para sa pagtubos matapos 
ang petsa kung saan ang mga pagbabayad sa pagbabayad ay binabayaran ng orihinal o dating depositor, ang deposito na institusyon ay 
dapat magpataw ng isang bayad sa pagtubos at ang mga tala na iyon ay pagkatapos ay ipagbibili sa diskwento laban sa tunay na salapi. 
Ang kawalan ng mga pamalit ng salapi ay dapat na patuloy na idepositong muli at muling ibalik upang mapanatili ang kanilang karakter bilang salapi-ang kanilang kapabayaan sa par-at sa gayon ay gumana sila bilang pansamantalang pera at tuluy-tuloy. Tanging ang tamang salapi (ang mga gintong barya) ay permanente na angkop upang maisagawa ang function bilang isang daluyan ng palitan. Sa gayon, malayo sa loob ng pera na nawala sa labas ng salapi, ang paggamit ng mga pamalit ng salapi ay dapat na inaasahan na maging malubha at limitado-limitado sa mahalagang transaksyon ng napakalaking halaga ng salapi at ang mga pakikitungo sa pagitan ng mga karaniwan na komersyal na negosyante-samantalang ang napakalaking kalakal ng ang populasyon ay gagamit ng tamang pera para sa karamihan ng kanilang mga pagbili o kaya ay benta, kaya nagpapakita ng kanilang kagustuhan para sa hindi nais na itani sa paraang sinasadya ni Friedman.[^11]

[^11]: Indeed, historically this has been the case: Traditionally, notes have always been widely distrusted, and their acceptability—as compared to that of genuine money such as gold or silver coins—was severely limited.

::::In order to increase the popularity of money substitutes two complementary measures were actually required: First, the note-issuing depositing institution had to overvalue deposit notes against genuine money by either charging no depositing fee or by even paying interest on deposits. Secondly, because the guarding of money is actually *not* costless and deposited money *cannot* possibly generate an interest return, the bank, in order to cover its otherwise unavoidable losses, had to engage in fractional reserve banking, i.e., it had to issue and bring into circulation new, additional deposit tickets that, while physically indistinguishable from any other notes, were actually not covered by genuine money.

::::On the ethical and economic status of the practice of fractional-reserve banking see the section, “From Deposit and Loan Banking to Fractional-Reserve Banking: The Devolution of Credit”, below.

Moreover, even if one assumed for the sake of argument that only inside money is in circulation while all genuine money is stored in a bank, the difficulties for fiat money proponents do not end here. To be sure, in their view matters appear simple enough: All commodity money sits idle in the bank. Wouldn’t it be more efficient if all of this idle gold were used instead for purposes of consumption or production—for dentistry or jewelry—while the function of a medium of exchange were assumed by a less expensive—indeed, practically costless—fiat money? Not at all.

First, the envisioned demonetization of gold certainly cannot mean that a bank thereby assumes ownership of the entire money stock, while the public gets to keep the notes. No one except the bank owner would agree to that! No one would want *such* savings. In fact, this would not be savings at all but an expropriation of the public by and to the sole advantage of the bank. No one could possibly *want* to be expropriated by somebody else. (Yet the expropriation of privately owned commodity money through governments and their central banks is the only method by which commodity money has ever been replaced by fiat money.) Instead, each depositor would want to retain ownership of his deposits and get his gold back.

Then, however, an insurmountable problem arises: Regardless who—the bank or the public—now owns the notes, they represent nothing but irredeemable paper. Formerly, the cost associated with the production of such paper was by no means only that of printing paper tickets, but more importantly that of attracting gold depositors through the provision of safeguarding and clearing services. Now, with irredeemable paper there is nothing worth guarding anymore. The cost of money production falls close to zero, to mere printing costs. Previously, with paper representing claims to gold, the notes had acquired purchasing power. But how can the bank or the public get anyone to accept them now? Would they be bought and sold for nonmoney goods at the formerly established exchange ratios? Obviously not. At least not as long as no legal barriers to entry into the note-production business existed; for under competitive conditions of free entry, if the (nonmoney) price paid for paper notes exceeded their production costs, the production of notes would immediately be expanded to the point at which the price of money approached its cost of production. The result would be hyperinflation. No one would accept paper money anymore, and a flight into *real values* would set in. The monetary economy would break down completely and society would revert back to a primitive, highly inefficient barter economy. Out of barter then, once again a new (most likely a gold) commodity money would emerge (and the note producers once again, so as to gain acceptability for their notes, would begin backing them by this money). What a way of achieving savings!

If one is to succeed in replacing commodity money by fiat money, then, an additional requirement must be fulfilled: Free entry into the note-production business must be restricted, and a money *monopoly* must be established. A single paper money producer is also capable of causing hyperinflation and a monetary breakdown. However, insofar as he is legally shielded from competition, a monopolist can safely and knowingly restrict the production of his notes and thus assure that they retain their purchasing power. He then presumably would assume the task of *redeeming* old notes at par for new ones, as well as that of again providing safeguarding and clearing services in accepting note deposits in exchange for his issuance of substitutes of notes—demand deposit accounts and checkbook money—against a depositing fee.

Regarding this scenario, several related questions arise. Formerly, with commodity money every person was permitted to enter the gold mining and coining business freely—in accordance with the assumption of self-interested, wealth-maximizing actors. In contrast, in order for Friedman’s “fiat money dividend” to come into existence, competition in the field of money production would have to be outlawed and a monopoly erected. Yet how can the existence of a legal monopoly be reconciled with the assumption of self-interest? Is it conceivable that self-interested actors could agree on establishing a fiat money monopoly in the same way as they can naturally agree on participating in the division of labor and on using one and the same commodity as a medium of exchange? If not, does this not demonstrate that the cost associated with such a monopoly must be considered higher than all attending resource cost savings?

To raise these questions is to answer them. Monopoly and the pursuit of self-interest are incompatible. To be sure, a reason why someone might want to become the money monopolist exists. After all, by not having to store, guard and redeem a precious commodity, the production costs would be dramatically reduced and the monopolist could thus reap an extra profit. By being legally protected from all future competition, this monopoly profit would immediately become “capitalized” (reflected permanently in an upward valuation of his assets), and on top of his inflated asset values he then would be guaranteed a normal rate of return in the form of interest. Yet to say that such an arrangement would be advantageous to the monopolist is not to say that it would be advantageous to anybody else, and hence that it could arise naturally. In fact, there is no motive for anyone wanting *anyone but himself* to be this monopolist, and accordingly no agreement on the selection of any particular monopolist would be possible. The position of a monopolist can only be arrogated—enforced against the will of all excluded nonmonopolists. By definition, a monopoly creates a distinction between two classes of individuals of different legal quality: between those—privileged—individuals who are permitted to produce money, and those—subordinate—ones who, to the exclusive advantage of the former, are prohibited from doing the same. Such an institution *cannot* be supported in the same voluntary way as the institutions of the division of labor and a commodity money. It is *not*, as they are, the “natural” result of mutually advantageous interactions, but that of an unilaterally advantageous act of expropriation (abrogation). Accordingly, instead of relying for its continued existence on voluntary support and cooperation, a monopoly requires the threat of physical violence.[^12]

[^12]: It might be argued that a monopoly agreement would be possible (conceivable), if the monopolistic bank of issue were owned by—and its profits distributed to—everyone. Wouldn’t everyone, then, not just the monopolist, profit from the savings of substituting paper for gold?

::::In fact, such an agreement is illusionary. Joint ownership of the monopoly bank would imply that tradeable stock certificates must be issued and distributed. But who should get how much stock? Bank clients, according to their deposit size? Yet all private holders of notes help save on gold and would want to be included among the bank owners according to the size of their note holdings. What about the owners and sellers of nonmoney goods? In showing themselves willing to accept paper instead of gold, they, too, play their part in the resource cost savings. But how in the world is one to determine how many shares to award *them* when their contribution consists, as it does, of various quantities of heterogeneous consumer and producer goods? Here, at the very latest it would become impossible to reach agreement.

::::Moreover, why would any new market participant—any later deposit, note and/or nonmoney good owner *not* initially endowed with bank stock—want to consent to and support this arrangement? Why should he *pay* for banking stock, while it was distributed to the initial wealth owners free of charge, even though he is now involved in resource cost savings just as much as they were then? Such an arrangement would involve a systematic redistribution of income and wealth in favor of all initial wealth owners and at the expense of all later ones. Yet if new additional bank stock were issued for each new deposit, note, or nonmoney good owner, such stock would be worthless from the outset and any bank offering it would be a nonstarter.

::::In addition, as will be explained below, regardless of how the ownership problem is resolved, the very operation of the bank will—indeed *must*—have effects on the interpersonal income and wealth distribution.

Moreover, the incompatibility of self-interest and monopoly does not end once the monopoly has been established but continues as long as the monopoly remains in operation. It cannot but operate inefficiently and at the expense of the excluded nonmonopolists. First, under a regime of free competition (free entry), every single producer is under constant pressure to produce whatever he produces at minimum costs, for if he does *not* do so, he invites the risk of being outcompeted by new entrants who produce the product in question at lower costs. In contrast, a monopolist, shielded from competition, is under no such pressure. In fact, since the cost of money production includes the monopolist’s own salary as well as all of his nonmonetary rewards, a monopolist’s “natural” interest is to *raise* his costs. Hence, it should be expected that the cost of a monopolistically provided paper money would very soon, if not from the very outset, *exceed* those associated with a competitively provided commodity money.

Furthermore, it can be predicted that the price of monopolistically provided paper money will steadily increase and the purchasing power per unit money, and its quality will continuously fall. Protected from new entrants, every monopolist is always tempted to raise price and lower quality. Yet this is particularly true of a money monopolist. While other monopolists must consider the possibility that price increases (or quality decreases) due to an elastic demand for their product may actually lead to reduced revenues, a money monopolist can rest assured that the demand for his particular product—the common medium of exchange—will be highly inelastic. Indeed, short of a hyperinflation, when the demand for money disappears entirely, a money monopolist is practically always in a position in which he may assume that his revenue from the sale of money will increase even as he raises the price of money (reduces its purchasing power). Equipped with the exclusive right to produce money and under the assumption of self-interest the monopoly bank should be expected to engage in a steady increase of the money supply, for while an increased supply of paper money does not add anything to social wealth—the amount of directly useful consumer and producer goods in existence—but merely causes inflation (lowers the purchasing power of money), with each additional note brought into circulation the monopolist can increase *his* real income (at the expense of lowering that of the non-monopolistic public). He can print notes at practically zero cost and then turn around and purchase *real* assets (consumer or producer goods) or use them for the repayment of *real* debts. The real wealth of the non-bank public will be reduced—they own less goods and more money of lower purchasing power. However, the monopolist’s real wealth will increase—he owns more non-money goods (and he always has as much money as he wants). Who, in this situation, except angels, would *not* engage in a steady expansion of the money supply and hence in a continuous depreciation of the currency?

It may be instructive to contrast the theory of fiat money as outlined above to the views of Milton Friedman, as the outstanding modern champion of fiat money.

While the younger Friedman paid no systematic attention to the question of the origin of money the older Friedman recognizes that, as a matter of historical fact, all monies originated as commodity monies (and all money substitutes as warehouse claims to commodity money), and he is justly skeptical of the older Friedrich A. Hayek’s proposal of competitively issued fiat currencies.[^13] However, misled by his positivist methodology Friedman fails to grasp that money (and money substitutes) *cannot* originate in any other way and accordingly that Hayek’s proposal must fail.


[^13]: See Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, “Has Government Any Role in Money?” *Journal of Monetary Economics* (1986); for Hayek’s proposal see his *Denationalization of Money* (London: Institute of Economic Affairs, 1976).

In contrast to the views developed here, throughout his entire work Friedman maintains that a commodity money in turn would be “naturally” replaced by a—more efficient, resource cost saving—fiat money regime. Amazingly, however, he offers no argumentative support for this thesis, evades all theoretical problems, and whatever argument or empirical observation he does offer *contradicts* his very claim. There is, first off, no indication that Friedman is aware of the fundamental limitations of replacing outside money by inside money. Yet if outside money cannot disappear from circulation, how, except through an act of expropriation, can the link between paper and a money commodity be severed? The continued use of outside money in circulation demonstrates that it is *not* regarded as an inferior money; and the fact that expropriation is needed for the decommoditization of money would demonstrate that fiat money is *not* a natural phenomenon!

Interestingly, after evading the problem of explaining how the suspension of redeemability can possibly be considered natural or efficient, Friedman quite correctly recognizes that fiat money cannot, for the reasons given above, be provided competitively but requires a monopoly. From there he proceeds to assert that “the production of fiat currency is, as it were, a natural monopoly”.[^14] However, from the fact that fiat money requires a monopoly, it does not follow that there is anything “natural” about such a monopoly and Friedman provides no argument whatsoever as to how any monopoly can possibly be considered the natural outcome of the interactions of self-interested individuals. Moreover, the younger Friedman in particular appears to be almost completely ignorant of classical political economy and its antimonopolistic arguments: the axiom that if you give someone a privilege he will make use of it, and hence the conclusion that every monopolistic producer will be inefficient (in terms of costs as well as of price and quality). In light of these arguments it has to be regarded as breathtakingly naive on Friedman’s part first to advocate the establishment of a governmental money monopoly and then to expect this monopolist *not* to use its power, but to operate at the lowest possible costs and to inflate the money supply only gently (at a rate of 3–5 percent per year). This would assume that, along with becoming a monopolist, a fundamental transformation in the self-interested nature of mankind would take place.


[^14]: See Friedman, *Essays in Positive Economics*, p. 216; also Friedman and Schwartz, “Has Government Any Role in Money?”

Having had extensive experience with his own ideal of a world of pure fiat currencies as it came into existence after 1971 and looking back on his own central resource cost savings argument for a monopolistically provided fiat money of nearly four decades earlier, it is not surprising that the older Friedman cannot but acknowledge that his predictions turned out blatantly false.[^15] Since abolishing the last remnants of the gold commodity money standard, he realizes, inflationary tendencies have dramatically increased on a worldwide scale; the predictability of future price movements has sharply decreased; the market for long-term bonds (such as consols) has been largely wiped out; the number of investment and “hard money” advisors and the resources bound up in such businesses have drastically increased; money market funds and currency futures markets have developed and absorbed significant amounts of real resources which otherwise—without the increased inflation and unpredictability—would not have come into existence at all or at least would never have assumed the same importance that they now have; and finally it appears that even the direct resource costs devoted to the production of gold accumulated in private hoards as a hedge against inflation have increased.[^16] But what conclusion does Friedman draw from this empirical evidence? In accordance with his own positivist methodology according to which science is prediction and false predictions falsify one’s theory, one should expect that Friedman would finally discard his theory as hopelessly wrong and advocate a return to commodity money. Not so. Rather, in a remarkable display of continued ignorance (or arrogance), he emphatically concludes that none of this evidence should be interpreted as “a plea for a return to a gold standard. On the contrary I regard a return to a gold standard as neither desirable nor feasible”.[^17] Now as then he holds onto the view that the appeal of the gold standard is merely “nonrational, emotional”, and that only a fiat money is “technically efficient”.[^18] According to Friedman, what needs to be done to overcome the obvious shortcomings of the current fiat money regime is find

[^16]: Monetarists had predicted that, as the result of the demonetization of gold and the transition to a pure fiat money system, the price of gold would fall—from the then official rate of $35 per ounce to an estimated nonmonetary value of gold of around $6\. In fact, the price of gold rose. At one point it reached $850 per ounce, and for most of the time it has lingered between $300 and $400\. As of this writing the price is $375.

> some anchor to provide long-term price predictability, some substitute for convertibility into a commodity or, alternatively some device that would make predictability unnecessary. Many possible anchors and devices have been suggested, from monetary growth rules to tabular standards to the separation of the medium of exchange from the unit of account. As yet, no consensus has been reached among them.[^19]

::::Among the suggestions for an alternative fiat money “anchor” recently considered by Friedman, the “frozen monetary base rule” deserves a brief comment (see Friedman, “Monetary Policy for the 1980s” in *To Promote Prosperity*, John H. Moore, ed. [Stanford: Hoover Institution, 1984]). In one respect this rule represents an advance over his earlier 3 to 5 percent monetary growth rule. His advocacy of the latter rule was based essentially on the erroneous proto-Keynesian notion that money constitutes part of social capital, such that an economy cannot grow by 5 percent unless it is accommodated to do so by a proportional increase in the money supply. In contrast, the frozen monetary base rule indicates a recognition of the old Humean insight that any supply of money is equally optimal or, in Friedman’s own words, that money’s “usefulness to the community as a whole does not depend on how much money there is (Friedman, *Money Mischief*, p. 28). Otherwise, the proposal represents no advance at all, for how in the world can a monopolist be expected to follow a frozen monetary base rule any more than a less stringent 3 to 5 percent growth rule?

::::Moreover, even if this problem were solved miraculously, this would still not alter the monopoly’s character as an instrument of unilateral expropriation and income and wealth redistribution. The monopolist, apart from offering depositing and clearing services (for which his customers would pay him a fee), would also have to perform the function, for customers and noncustomers alike, of replacing old, worn-out notes—one-to-one and free of charge—with new, identical ones (otherwise, who would want to replace a permanent commodity money by a perishable fiat money?). However, while the costs associated with this task may be low, they are definitely not zero. Accordingly, in order to avoid losses and recoup his expenses, the monopolist cannot but *increase* the monetary base—and hence one would essentially be back at the older monetary growth rule.
